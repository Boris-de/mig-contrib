Grabexif generates exif.inf files for use by mig (mig.sf.net), from the html
files found on the Casio QV-7000SX (and others?). Your html file from the
camera should resemble the following:

...
<TABLE WIDTH="540" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0"><TR>
<TD WIDTH="320" ALIGN="CENTER"><B>02828001.JPG</B></TD>
<TD WIDTH="20"></TD>
...
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times"><PRE> : 476Kbyte

 : Super Fine
 : Single shutter
 : Programmed AE

</PRE></FONT>
...

Using that info, grabexif should generate a logical file. A sample html file
has been included for testing, as well as what a 'proper' exif.inf file should
look like.
